### 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
To make a new habit or stick to it, we must make the action incredibly small like flossing one tooth. Then immediately
follow with a small positive reward like shouting "I am awesome" to positively wire out brain.
The speaker only achieved  long term weight loss by replacing willpower with many small, simple habits.

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
To make habits easy by stop relying on motivation and instead,  make the habit super tiny (eg ine push-up), and link it
to a consistent task or thing which we already do like after having lunch or having coffee.
* M = Motivation(Energy or behaviour to do something).
* A = Ability(How easy or difficult the task we want to do).
* P = Prompt(The trigger or reminder t do the task).

### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
Immediately celebrating even a simple thing like "I am awesome" generates a feeling of success. This positive emotion is
what quickly wires the tiny behaviour in our brain boosting confidence and motivation  to do it again.

### 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The team achieved olympic domination by focusing on making tiny, 1% improvements in every area, even things like
finding best pillow or teaching better hand-washing. This proves that massive success comes  from treating small, 
consistent improvements as the core engine of change.

### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
It teaches that we should shift our focus from what to achieve to who we want to become. Every small habit we do is a 
"vote" for the new identity. Believe in yourself and for that this self belief creates the strongest motivation.

### 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
Make it Easy (Ability): We must reduce  the number  of steps between the good habit and ourselves. For example if we
want to learn DSA leave the laptop and all the study material in front of you instead of packed it in the bag
Two-Minute rule: Focus in making the start of the habit in less than two minutes.

### 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
Make it invincible: Remove the cue that triggers the habit from our sight. If we want to stop eating junk food, put
them far out of sight.
Make it Difficult: Increase the steps needed to do the bad habit. If we want to stop using phones keep them far awy in
another room. The extra effort often kills the urge.

### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
* Obvious: I'll leave my laptop open to the coding editor and prompt. After I close my work laptop, I will write one
line of code.
* Easy: My tiny habit is only to solve one single question (the two-minute rule).
* Satisfying: I will immediately mark a check in my habit tracker and tell myself, "I am a consistent programmer."


### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do le ss of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
* Invisible: I'll delete the apps and access social media only via the browser, logging out every time.
  * Hard: I'll use an app blocker to block social media during work hours, making it too disruptive to check.
* Unsatisfying: I'll set a strict daily timer (eg 15 minutes). Once time is up, the app is locked, making any further 
checking immediately unsatisfying.
