### What is Deep Work?
* Deep Work is focusing completely without any distractions on a cognitively demanding task that pushes your abilities to their limit.
* It is considered the most valuable skill for producing high-quality, valuable work.

### According to author how to do deep work properly, in a few points?
* Schedule Distractions: Set firm, scheduled times (e.g. in the afternoon) to check email and social media do not check them randomly throughout the day.
* Build a Ritual: Create a simple, regular habit for starting deep work (e.g. same place, same time) to remove the energy needed to decide when to focus.
* Use the Shutdown Ritual: At the end of the day, create a complete plan for handling any unfinished tasks the next day. This signals to your mind that the work is contained and allows you to rest fully.

### How can you implement the principles in your day to day life?
* Block out specific hours, typically when interruptions are lowest (like early morning), for my most complex work.
* Enforce strict boundaries, only allowing social media and email checks during my scheduled "distraction breaks."
* Use the shutdown routine daily to ensure a clear boundary between work and rest.

### What are the dangers of social media, in brief?
* Ruins Your Focus: Social media is made to be addicting. It teaches your brain to constantly stop what we are doing and check it, which makes it harder to focus on difficult tasks later on.
* Makes You Feel Bad: Seeing only the perfect parts of other people's lives can make us feel like your own life isn't good enough. This leads to feeling alone and sad.
* Hurts Real Connections: We spend less time strengthening real-life friendships because we are focused on passive online interaction.
* Creates Stress: Social media rewards (likes, comments) pop up randomly, which keeps our mind focused on checking it.
* Wastes Time: Social media is designed to keep us hooked like a game, making us spend time on things that don't help us grow.
